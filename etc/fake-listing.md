# Senior Engineering Lead – Advanced Pursuit Technologies
## ACME Corporation

*Location: Remote with Frequent Desert Field Testing*

At ACME Corporation, we push the boundaries of innovation, crafting cutting-edge solutions that redefine the laws of physics (and occasionally, gravity). Our Advanced Pursuit Technologies division is seeking a **Senior Engineering Lead** to design and develop next-generation contraptions, gadgets, and high-speed interceptors. If you have a knack for solving complex engineering challenges—and an interest in helping a certain tenacious coyote achieve long-awaited success—this role is for you.

### **What You’ll Do**
- Lead and mentor a team of high-impact engineers to develop high-speed, high-impact solutions.
- Design, prototype, and optimize advanced pursuit systems, from rocket-powered roller skates to precision-guided anvils.
- Work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure our products are fast, effective, and (mostly) safe.
- Analyze test results (successful or otherwise) to refine and enhance performance.
- Push the boundaries of engineering ingenuity, exploring novel approaches to classic chase scenarios.

### **What You Bring**
- A strong background in mechanical, aerospace, or systems engineering.
- Experience leading engineering teams in high-stakes, high-speed environments.
- Proven ability to innovate under pressure and iterate on explosive (sometimes literally) designs.
- Expertise in propulsion systems, kinetic energy deployment, and desert survival tactics.
- A results-driven mindset with an affinity for relentless pursuit and creative problem-solving.

### **Why ACME?**
- Work on legendary, industry-defining technology.
- Join a team that values out-of-the-box thinking (and occasionally, out-of-the-canyon landings).
- Competitive compensation, robust benefits, and a generous "trial and error" budget.

If you’re ready to take engineering to the next level and finally turn the chase in our favor, we want to hear from you!

**Apply today—let’s catch that Roadrunner.**
